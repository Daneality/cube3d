# cube3d
First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).

### Controls

You can move around the maze with ``W`` ``A`` ``S`` ``D``.

You can also rotate the view with the directional arrows ``←`` and ``→``.

You can shoot/stab with ``SPACE`` and open doors with ``SHIFT``.

To exit the game, press ``ESC`` or click the red cross.

### The mandatory part

The basic program that was required to pass. It only includes wall textures and a sprite ; no floor/ceiling textures, no weapons, no enemies, no game elements at all.
